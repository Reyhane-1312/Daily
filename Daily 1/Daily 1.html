
<!-- The main structure of an HTML page is as follows: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Main Heading</h1>
    <p>Main Text</p>
</body>
</html>
<!-- HTML tags are used to structure the text and content of a web page. For example:

- <html>: Specifies the start and end of an HTML page.
- <head>: Contains information about the page such as the title, styles, and scripts.
- <title>: Specifies the title of the page.
- <body>: The main content area of the page containing all content like text, images, and links.
- <h1>, <p>: Tags for displaying headings and paragraphs.

Other tags such as <div>, <span>, <a>, <img>, etc., are also used for structuring content and adding various elements to the page. -->
 <!-- The <p> tag in HTML is used to display paragraphs. This tag is used to display text or textual content within a paragraph. 
 In other words, whenever you want to introduce a section of text as a paragraph, you use the <p> tag.
 Example: -->
 <p>This is a sample text placed in an HTML paragraph.</p>
 <!-- In this example, the text "This is a sample text placed in an HTML paragraph." is displayed as a paragraph using the <p> tag -->
    <!-- The <h1> to <h6> tags in HTML are used to create different headings and organize content. These tags range from <h1>, which is the largest heading, to <h6>, 
    which is the smallest heading, defining the hierarchy of headings from largest to smallest.
        - <h1>: Used for the main title of a page or main section.
        - <h2>: Used for secondary titles and important sections.
        - <h3> to <h6>: Used for subheadings and less important sections. -->
            <h1>Main Title</h1>
            <h2>Secondary Title</h2>
            <h3>Third Title</h3>
            <h4>Fourth Title</h4>
            <h5>Fifth Title</h5>
            <h6>Sixth Title</h6>
            <!-- In this example, each <h1> to <h6> tag is used to display different headings, indicating the importance and organization of the content. -->
