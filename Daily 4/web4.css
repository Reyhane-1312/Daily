  /* Selectors in CSS are used to select and apply visual styles to HTML elements.
  There are different types of selectors that allow you to choose the elements you want. Below are explanations of some important types of selectors:

    1. Element Selector:
   This type of selector selects based on the HTML element name. For example: */
      p {
       color: blue;
   }
   
   /* This selector selects all <p> elements on the page and makes their text color blue.

    2. Class Selector:
    With this type of selector, you can select elements that have a specific class. For example: */
      .highlight {
       background-color: yellow;
   }
   
    /* This selector selects all elements with the class highlight and sets their background color to yellow.

    3. ID Selector:
    This type of selector works based on the unique ID given to an HTML element. For example: */
      #header {
       font-size: 24px;
   }
   
   /* This selector selects the element with the ID header and sets its font size to 24 pixels.

    4. Combined Selector:
    You can combine multiple selectors to select elements that meet all the specified conditions. For example: */
      p.highlight {
       font-weight: bold;
   }
   
    /* This selector selects all <p> elements with the class highlight and makes their text bold.

    Using selectors, you will be able to style your HTML elements in a precise and efficient manner. */

   /* In CSS, you can use HTML tags to change the color, size, and style of text, as well as fonts. Below are explanations of these features:

   1. Changing text color:
   To change the color of text in an HTML tag, you can use the color property. For example: */
      p {
       color: blue;
   }
   
   /* This code sets all <p> tags to have blue text color.

    2. Changing text size:
   To change the size of text in an HTML tag, you can use the font-size property. For example: */
      h1 {
       font-size: 36px;
   }
   
   /* This code sets the size of all <h1> tags to 36 pixels.

    3. Changing text style:
   To change the style of text in an HTML tag, you can use various properties such as font-weight, font-style, and text-decoration. For example: */
      .bold-text {
       font-weight: bold;
   }

   em {
       font-style: italic;
   }

   .underline {
       text-decoration: underline;
   }
   
   /* These codes respectively make text with the class bold-text bold, <em> tags italic, and all tags with the class underline underlined.

    4. Changing font:
   To change the font of an HTML tag, you can use the font-family property. For example: */
      body {
       font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
   }
   
   /* This code sets the font of the document body to Arial font, and if this font is not supported, a fallback font will be used.

    By using these features, you will be able to customize the appearance and style of text on your web pages as desired. */

    /* In CSS, you can use different types of font styles to design your websites. Some of the font styles include:
    1. font-style: normal;: This style gives the text a normal and upright shape.
    2. font-style: italic;: This style gives the text an italic and slanted shape.
    3. font-style: oblique;: This style gives the text an oblique and slanted shape, but the difference with italic is that the font itself is slanted and not just visually.
    4. font-style: initial;: This style applies the default font style to the text.
    5. font-style: inherit;: This style inherits the font style from its direct parent or ancestor.
    By using these font styles, you can customize the appearance and style of your text as desired and create an attractive design for your website. */
