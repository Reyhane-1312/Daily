    <!-- Attributes in HTML specify additional information that can be added to tags to define their characteristics.
     Attributes are defined as key-value pairs, meaning each attribute has a name (key) and a value.

    For example, in the <a> tag used to create links, the href attribute is used to specify the destination address of the link, as follows: -->

    
        <a href="https://example.com">Visit our website</a>

     <!-- Here, href is an attribute with the value being the desired website address.

    Some common attributes in HTML include:

    1. id: Used to specify a unique identifier for an element.
    2. class: Used to specify a specific class or group for an element.
    3. src: Used to specify the source address (such as an image or audio file) for <img> and <audio> tags, and so on.
    4. alt: Used to specify alternative text for images.
    5. title: Used to specify a title or description related to an element.

    The presence and use of attributes allow web designers to better organize web pages and provide more information to users. -->

    <!-- The <img> tag in HTML is used to display images on web pages. This tag is a self-closing tag, meaning it does not require a closing tag.

    To add an image to a web page using the <img> tag, you need to use its attributes. One of the important attributes of the <img> tag is src, which specifies the image file's address.

    Below is a simple example of using the <img> tag: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Homepage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the website!</h1>
    <p>Below is a sample image:</p>
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="Sample Image">
</body>
</html>


    <!-- In this example, the <img> tag with the src attribute is used to display the image example.jpg. Additionally, the alt attribute is used to specify alternative text for the image in case it fails to load properly.

    By using the <img> tag, you can add images to your web pages and visually present them.

        <!-- Tables are an important tool in HTML for displaying data in a structured format. Tables in HTML are created using the <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> tags.

        Here is a simple example of a table in HTML: -->
        
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Arman</td>
            <td>25</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Sara</td>
            <td>30</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        
        
        <!-- Explanation:
        - <table>: The main tag for creating a table.
        - <tr>: Tag for creating a row in the table.
        - <th>: Tag for creating header cells in the table.
        - <td>: Tag for creating data cells in the table.
        
        In this example, a table with two columns (Name and Age) and two data rows (Arman and Sara) is created. The content of each cell goes inside the <th> or <td> tags.
        
        Using CSS properties, you can also customize the appearance of the table, such as background color, borders, and fonts.
        
        With these explanations, you can create different tables with your own data. -->

        <!-- In HTML, you can use the <ul>, <ol>, and <li> tags to create lists. These tags allow you to create unordered or ordered lists on your web pages.

         1. Unordered List:
         To create an unordered list, you use the <ul> and <li> tags. Each item in the list is displayed using the <li> tag. By default, unordered lists are displayed with bullets or circles. -->
            
                  <ul>
                 <li>Item 1</li>
                 <li>Item 2</li>
                 <li>Item 3</li>
               </ul>
               
            
            <!-- 2. Ordered List:
            To create an ordered list, you use the <ol> and <li> tags. Each item in the list is displayed using the <li> tag. By default, ordered lists are displayed with sequential numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.). -->
            
                  <ol>
                 <li>Item 1</li>
                 <li>Item 2</li>
                 <li>Item 3</li>
               </ol>
               
            
            <!-- 3. Nested Lists:
            You can nest unordered or ordered lists within each other to create nested lists. -->
            
                  <ul>
                 <li>Item 1</li>
                 <li>Item 2
                   <ul>
                     <li>Nested item 1</li>
                     <li>Nested item 2</li>
                   </ul>
                 </li>
                 <li>Item 3</li>
               </ul>
               
            
            <!-- Using these tags, you can create different types of lists on your web pages and present information in an organized and structured manner. -->
